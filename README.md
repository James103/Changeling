# Changeling

*"To become a thing is to know a thing."* -The Dominion, Star Trek DS9

Changeling is a shapeshifting mod for Minecraft. With the mod, you can kill mobs to get the ability to "morph" into them. While morphed, you may also be able to use abilities of some vanilla mobs. Check your controls in the in-game options menu to see how to use the mod.

Changeling is a fork of McHorse's Metamorph with the goal of staying as close to the original mod as possible, while paying more attention to gameplay-related bugs. On its own, Changeling is a lightweight mod which allows you to morph for convenience or roleplay, and provides configuration options to disable features and tweak morphs. Changeling also contains a powerful API which other mod developers can use to create add-ons or use the mod as a morphing backend.
